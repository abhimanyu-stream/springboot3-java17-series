//The Strategy Pattern is ideal for a situation where multiple algorithms (or strategies) can be applied to a specific task.
// In this example, weâ€™ll use the Strategy Pattern to implement an e-commerce application that can handle different payment methods (like PayPal, Stripe, and Square), making it easy to switch between them without modifying the core logic of the application.
