In a Spring Boot application, the root directory typically refers to the directory where the main application class (the one with the @SpringBootApplication annotation) resides. This is also the directory from which you run the application using the mvn spring-boot:run command.

Key Points:

Project Root:

This is the top-level directory of your Spring Boot project, containing the pom.xml file and other project files.

Source Code Root:

By default, the source code for your application resides in the src/main/java directory within the project root.

Static Content Root:

If you have static content (e.g., images, CSS files), they are typically placed in the src/main/resources/static directory.
Example:

If your main application class is located at src/main/java/com/example/MyApp.java, then the root directory of your Spring Boot application would be the directory containing the src folder.
